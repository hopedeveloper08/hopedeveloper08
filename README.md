I engineer robust, dynamic front-end interfaces with React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and build powerful, scalable back-end systems with Django. My skill set extends beyond traditional web development; I have a foundational background in data analysis and machine learning, which informs my approach to building intelligent systems. I am particularly passionate about and skilled in developing cutting-edge AI applications, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and mastering essential techniques like prompt engineering to create innovative, next-generation solutions.
